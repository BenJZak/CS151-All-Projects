'''
Program designed to estimate how many students will not attend a class
based on specific user based criteria.

This program is for PA0 of my CS151 class.

print("This program will help you estimate the attendance of your class!")

studentCount = int(input("How many students are enrolled in your class?: "))
isQuiz = input("Is there a quiz for your class today? Y/N: ").lower().strip() == 'y'
isHomework = input("Is there a lot of Homework due today? Y/N: ").lower().strip() == 'y'
isOptional = input("Is todays class optional? Y/N: ").lower().strip() == 'y'
#inputs that gather a true boolean value based on whether or not the user inputs a y (not case sensitive)
#.lower() converts a capital Y to a lowercase y, and .strip() removes any spaces if the user may input one on accident

if(isQuiz == True):
    studentCount = studentCount * .95
if(isHomework == True):
    studentCount = studentCount * .95
if(isOptional == True):
    studentCount = studentCount * .8
#performs the calculations based on averaged data reported by various sources, if the boolean values are true

studentCount = int(studentCount)
#removes decimal values, as you cannot have half a student

print("It is estimated that", studentCount, "students will attend your class based on the given criteria.")
