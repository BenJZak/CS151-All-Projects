# Programmers: Ben + Andrew
# Course:  CS151 Dr. Kenyon 
# Due Date: 12/11/23
#PA: 5
# Problem Statement: In this assignment you will create a program that organizes Pokemon for the user.
# Input Files: pokmndf.csv
# Credit: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_any.asp

# Purpose: reads in the data from pokmndf.csv file and returns it as a list of lists
# Parameters: NA
# Return: list of lists
